# Penguin_dataset_EDA

## 
Dataset Overview:
- The penguin dataset contains 344 samples of penguins from three different species:
Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo.
- The dataset consists of several attributes for each penguin, including bill length, bill
depth, flipper length, and body mass.
- Additionally, categorical variables such as species, island (location), and sex are also
included.

## 
- Handling missing data: Check for missing values in the dataset and decide on a strategy
to handle them (e.g., imputation or removal).
- Encoding categorical variables: Convert categorical variables like species, island, and
sex into numerical representations that machine learning algorithms can process.
